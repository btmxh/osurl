# osurl

worst osu raylib clone in under 100 lines, without:
- accurate input timing
- error handling (it will segfault xdddd)
- a proper build system (only dependency is [raylib](https://raylib.com))
- done in something like 10 mins idk (1 hour if testplay + looking at the docs + etc. included idk)

bm dir contains some assets taken from osugame ([lionheart](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1390922)) go there for the full map

idc about the code so public domain or whatever
